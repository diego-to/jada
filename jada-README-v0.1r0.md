The Jada project consists of 5 releases.. 1.- Jades Cryptocurrecy 2.- Jada V DeFi Wallet 3.- Libereco (DeFi Instruments) 4.- Fortuno (Economy Driver) 5.- Jada Ai (Artificial General Intelligence)
We will be sharing source code for each release only upon public release.
As each release receives an update (v = version, r = revision) we will be replacing the source code in this repository.

1.- Our first code release, is for our Jada Cryptocurrency
Jada, plural: Jades, current ticker: jadx, current name on code: Jada Finance
Features: A simple erc-20 token smart contract on the Ethereum Main Net with a "freeze contract" feature to be used exclusively in the case that disabling this chain becomes necessary due to the following:

a) After complete migration to another blockchain.
b) The current smart contract will be replaced in favor of another.
c) We decide to launch a proprietary blockchain

In any of the above events, 1:1 token swaps will be supported, whie allowing users to decide which blockchain they would like to remain on.
